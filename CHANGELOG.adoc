= Changelog

== 2.1.7

Support added for customizable branch names.

The implied default is `main`.

Any setting that accepts a Git repository URL,
which are named following the `*_repo_url` convention
(`git_repo_url`, `repo_url`, or `github_repo_url`),
accepts a sibling setting `*_repo_branch` which will override
the implied default and site-wide `default_repo_branch` value.

[IMPORTANT]
.Breaking change
====
The default branch name is now `main`, which is a departure from the previously hard-coded `master`.

Quick migration guide:

* If your site references (using `*_repo` properties) repositories that
  use other main branch name than `main`,
  locate those references in .adoc YAML frontmatter
  and add sibling
  properties in the shape of `*_repo_branch` (basically, adding `_branch` suffix),
  assigning the actual branch name used in each circumstance.
* If your sites all use another branch name than `main`,
  you can edit all sites’ `_config.yml` files
  and specify your custom branch name using `default_repo_branch` property.
  **(If you opt to use this way of configuration,
  and you unite multiple open project sites under a single hub site,
  you must make sure `default_repo_branch` property in `_config.yml` files is the same
  across all sites, as well as the hub site.
  If that’s impossible, please use the previous option.)**

If you experience site build failures after the update, the error that looks something like below
would indicate that the build fails due to branch name issue:

```
in `command': git
'--git-dir=/site/path/some/repository/path/.git'
<...part removed for clarity>
pathspec 'origin/some_branch_name' did not match any file(s) known to git
(Git::GitExecuteError)
```

In the above example, project site is trying to fetch a repository
(e.g., for software documentation) using `some_branch_name` as the main branch,
while that repository in fact uses a different one.
You can use `/site/path/some/repository/path` to locate the relevant .adoc (or .md) file with frontmatter YAML
and override branch name there.

as invalid Liquid markup.

== 2.0.17

[IMPORTANT]
.Breaking change
====
Blog post permalinks were changed to be in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD-<post title>`.

It’s recommended to specify redirects for posts
(using jekyll-redirect-from plugin and `redirect_from` frontmatter key).
For example, this would ensure that a blog post named `2025-12-31-hello-world.adoc`
will still work under the pre-2.0.17 URL scheme, redirecting to the new path:

[source,yaml]
--
redirect_from:
  - /blog/12-31-2025/hello-world/
--
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Breaking changes
====
* Update software & spec entry point frontmatter according to new external link support
  (some YAML keys are now obsolete).
* If you customize styling:
** Rename SASS variable $superhero-background.
   Details below & in the styling customization part of theme’s README.
** Beware of changes in project & hub site landing pages’ HTML markup structure.
** Beware of minor styling refactoring across the board.
====

=== Software & specs external links overhaul (BREAKING)

Software and spec entry points now support `external_links` key in YAML frontmatter.
External links are specified as one array
of objects, each with a required `url` and an optional `title` property.

This is a more natural any to configure any third-party site links
such as source repositories, documentation (for software), specification views (for specs).

Frontmatter keys previously used to achieve the same purpose are now obsolete:

* Software’s `docs_url`
* Spec’s `ietf_datatracker_*`, `rfc_id`, `source_url`

NOTE: For software, now specifying the mandatory repo_url does not automatically result
in source repository link being shown anymore.
You must have repository URL in external_links if you want the link to appear.
(This might seem as redundant, but it also allows to not hide the repository link if desired.)

=== Project site landing page overhaul (BREAKING)

In addition to purely looks (e.g., using full-height background),
landing pages for project sites were made more convenient.

There was a change in design approach—from landing pages focused
on one single call-to-action, to landing pages with more actions
and higher information density.

==== Simplified landing page layout for single-software projects

If an open project consists of only one software package (which is somewhat typical),
its site’s landing page will be simplified.

==== Customizable landing page section order

Introduced site-wide configuration key landing_priority.

Project sites can use it to change section order for the landing (home) page,
and specify a custom intro include. For an example, see Metanorma and Cryptode sites
in Ribose Open network.

==== More useful actions exposed

* Visitors can now quickly jump into software’s documentation:
  if software has docs (and top-level navigation items are clickable),
  links to up to three first documentation sections are displayed.

* Software & spec cards now show external links, allowing visitors to quickly
  download software or view specification on SDO site or elsewhere.

=== Miscellaneous UI updates & styling refactoring (BREAKING)

* HTML structure on landing has simplified. If you rely on it for styling purposes
  in your sites’ style.scss, you may want to check
  that your styling rules keep working as intended.

* SASS rules across the board were updated, and a couple variables changed names.

** The $superhero-background variable is now called $main-background.

*** By default, it is now a gradient based on primary and accent colors.

** $hero-background variable has been removed.

** `.item` selector on `<li>` elements in navigation blocks is no longer used.

* Removed “tagline” after main title from stock spec & software index pages hero include.
  It didn’t add much and required extra copywriting effort.

* Removed redundant Home link in top site navigation.

* Made sure that there is spacing between site content & viewport edge,
  which used to be uncomfortably tight on particular viewport widths
  around responsive media query breakpoints.

* Footer layout was updated.

* “Featured” indicator on software & spec cards no longer features a thumbs-up emoji.

* Many smaller changes across the board.

=== Improved documentation page UX

When navigating to a path with an anchor (hash) in URL:

* The anchor itself should not be obscured by site header anymore
  (the page will immediately scroll up a bit, readers shouldn’t notice that).

* The link corresponding to appropriate section is highlighted in the navigation sidebar.

Page header and navigation sidebar were made a bit cleaner.

=== Bug fixes

* Stopped adding external link marker & bottom border to certain links (e.g., OSS badges).

* Fixed layout issue in top menu, which used to slightly break layout when very long.

* On hub site software & spec indexes, fixed vertical alignment of project icon on item cards.

* Relaxed constraint where spec build’s PNG diagrams engine required specific navigation.

A few updates to how some blocks in AsciiDoc-generated markup appear visually,
including marking warning and important admonition block with colour.

== 1.3.2

A few updates to how some blocks in AsciiDoc-generated markup appear visually
(admonition blocks, listing blocks and figure titles).

A couple of bugfixes to new documentation navigation widget’s behavior.

== 1.2

This update features a major update to documentation UX.

- Enabled project-wide documentation via `docs-base` layout (see Metanorma’s example),
  integrated with the same navigation UX as software docs

Major update to docs navigation UX:

- Now an expandable side panel that can stay on screen while reading

- Now reusable across other docs in addition to software docs

Bugfixes:

- Blog entries are now sorted by timestamp descending, as expected

- Added support for displaying specification contents as part of
  project sites. In this first iteration, only PNG diagrams
  as in Metanorma model specs are supported

- Added support for new simpler way of configuring software/spec navigation
  through document frontmatter, rather than a separate `navigation.adoc` file
  (the latter approach is to be deprecated)

- Fixed an issue where featured software cards on project site landing
  would not display namespaced tags correctly

- Layout improvements & fixes

== 1.1.24

- Improved tag filtering experience

- Added support for tag namespaces

- Fixed a bug where search widget would attempt to be initialized
  in absence of search input

== 1.1.23

  by adding a key to Jekyll’s _config.yml

- Now linking software docs to corresponding GitHub’s edit pages,
  a shortcut to allow documentation readers suggest edits
  with less friction

- Simplified deployment by bundling Rakefile and .travis.yml
  and documenting the corresponding GitHub -> AWS S3 setup in CI_OPS

== 1.1.22

- Fixed an issue with software documentation landing page layout
  not displaying correctly depending on viewport height & the amount
  of landing page contents (Firefox only)

- Started marking external links within main site contents

== 1.1.21

  that caused cards from hub site software & spec indexes to not link
  to their pages on corresponding project sites, 404’ing instead.

== 1.1.19

Improved software and spec indexes on both hub and project sites:

- Order software and specs by last update timestamp, descending

- Highlight featured software and specs

- Show featured software/specs first in corresponding index listing on project sites

== 1.1.18

Updated layout of landing pages for both project and hub sites.

- Fixed issues with inelegant whitespace

- Hero unit look updated overall, is now more compact

- Now showing featured items as a grid

== 1.1.17

Fixed an issue with code listings not always being horizontally scrollable,
in those cases causing layout of documentation pages to exceed screen width.

Added favicon to base page meta (sites are expected to provide
`/assets/favicon.png` and `/assets/webclip.png` now).

Made top header collapse on scroll for better readability on smaller screens.
Made documentation ToC collapsible as well.

[IMPORTANT]
.Breaking change
====
Navigation block on documentation pages has changed its
selector from `.nav-sidebar` to `.docs-nav`; sites customizing that have to
update the selector in HTML/CSS.
====


== 1.1.16

Improved formatting of code snippets, lists, tables and admonition blocks.

== 1.1.14-15

Incremental improvements to content presentation & formatting:

- More consistent formatting of code snippets in docs and elsewhere on the site

- Nicer styling of tables in article bodies

- Whitespace consistency here and there

- Better formatting of TBD labels

== 1.1.13

- More consistent formatting of code snippets in docs and elsewhere on the site

- Fixed a problem with fetched software documentation not always being rendered
  as part of project site

== 1.1.12

- Some changes in SASS structure aimed to improve customizability
  of Open Project framework-based site UIs

== 1.1.11

- Even faster processing when `refresh_remote_data` is set to 'skip'

- More flexible customization means for sites using the OP framework

- Layout improvements across screen widths

- Minor documentation page layout & content formatting improvements

== 1.1.10

=== Synchronized versions & centralized change log

- Each theme version will require (in its gemspec) the exact helpers library version

- Theme’s CHANGELOG will reflect the development of Open Project framework
  regardless of whether the actual changes belong to theme or helpers gem

=== Fixes to multi-site data integration

- A few issues in data-fetching logic were fixed, now certain edge cases (such as missing
  software docs) are handled better and (re)generation of sites,
  especially for projects with many software packages and for project hubs,
  should be faster on average.

- Site’s `_config.yml` now supports optional string flag `refresh_remote_data`
  with three possible values: 'always', 'last-resort' (default), and 'skip'.

-- The default 'last-resort' choice means site build will attempt to fetch remote data
    (such as last software update timestamp, software docs, hub logos, etc.)
    when there is no local copy.
  
-- 'always' may be helpful during development if you have a local copy from previous build,
    but the remote data has changed and you want your local sites to reflect that.
  
-- 'skip' will always leave local data intact and not attempt to contact remote repositories,
    which would speed up regeneration during debugging or development
    where you know you have a local copy alreay fetched as needed
    (otherwise it’s likely going to break your build).

== 1.1.9

Build-related fix:

- Correct ``exclude`` to ensure hub site doesn’t try to build software docs

Software documentation improvements:

- Fixes to hosted (‘internal’) documentation page layout

- Slightly more expressive formatting on documentation pages (highlighting “tip” blocks)

- Improvements to how external documentation links are shown

Various fixes and improvements:

- Make hamburger menu script external to facilitate CSP policy implementation

- Minor changes to layout & default copy

- Remove redundant ARIA role definition from presentational divs

== 1.1.8

- Minor improvements to layout & default copy phrasing here and there

- Correct ``excludes`` in default ``_config.yml`` definition in the theme
  to prevent Jekyll from trying to build what shouldn’t be built

== 1.1.7

Improved documentation layout:

- Show external link markers

- Fix an issue with “Documentation” header shown on item docs landing
  even if no documentation pages exist

Bugfixes:

- Show tags in human-readable form (with underscores replaced to spaces)
  on software & spec cards


== 1.1.6

Much improved documentation layout:

- Docs landing page features commonly used external links
  (external API reference docs, repository, IETF datatracker, etc.)
  more prominently

- Fixed how code samples are shown in documentation pages

- Fixed documentation page layout issues on narrower screens

== 1.1.5

A couple of layout tweaks:

- Preserve clickability of active item in top menu
- Make software documentation/spec page layout fit narrow screens

== 1.1.4

- A few improvements to sites’ layout on narrow screens

== 1.1.3

- A few appearance updates, including more elegant layout
  and hamburger menu on narrower screens.

== 1.1.2

- Fixed an issue preventing hub site build if child project sites’
  SCSS imported files from outside the assets directory

== 1.1.1

- Fixed an issue breaking Jekyll build on sites which do not have
  a scripts.html include

== 1.1.0

Minor features:

- Update default layout to allow sites plug custom JS via scripts.html include
- Add an ID to default `<link>` element (allows sites to change
  the stylesheet from a script for custom theming)

Other changes:

- Changed site type and layout classes added on `<body>` by the theme,
  aiming to make the selectors more explicit and clear.

  **BREAKING:** This breaks custom styling on sites where it relies
  on old-style `body.layout-layoutname`, `body.hub`, `body.project` selectors.

  Corresponding new selectors would be
  `body.layout--layoutname`, `body.site--hub`, `body.site--project`.

== 1.0.10

- Implemented optional key `feature_with_priority` for software and specs (#28)
- Added CHANGELOG
